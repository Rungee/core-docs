.NET Primer
===========

.NET is a general purpose development platform. It can be used for any
kind of app type or workload where general purpose solutions are used.
It has several key features that are attractive to many developers,
including automatic memory management and modern programming languages,
that make it easier to efficiently build high-quality apps. .NET enables
a high-level programming environment with many convenience features,
while providing low-level access to native memory and APIs.

Multiple implementations of .NET are available, based on open `.NET
Standards <https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/dotnet-standards.md>`_ that specify the fundamentals of the
platform. They are separately optimized for different app types (e.g.
desktop, mobile, gaming, cloud) and support many chips (e.g. x86/x64,
ARM) and operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, OS X).
Open source is also an important part of the .NET ecosystem, with
multiple .NET implementations and many libraries available under
OSI-approved licenses.

You can take a look at the :doc:`<getting-started/overview>` document to figure out all of the different editions of .NET Framework that are available, both Microsoft's and others.

Key .NET Concepts
-----------------

There is a certain number of concepts that are very important to understand if you are new to the .NET Platform. These concepts are the cornerstone of the entire platform, and understanding them at the outset is important for general understanding of how .NET works.

A stroll through .NET
---------------------

As any mature and advanced application development framework, .NET has many powerful features that make the developer's job easier and aim to make writing code more powerful and expressive. This section will outline the basics of the most salient features and provide pointers to more detailed discussions where needed. After finishing this stroll, you should have enough information to be able to read the samples on our GitHub repos as well as other code and understand what is going on.

* Automatic memory management
* Type safety
* The managed compiler
* Delegates and lambdas
* Generics
* LINQ
* Asynchronous support
* Dynamic language features
* Code contracts
* Native interoperability


Automatic memory management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Memory Safety
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the less obvious but quite far-reaching features that a garbage
collector enables is memory safety. The invariant of memory safety is
very simple: a program is memory safe if it accesses only memory that
has been allocated (and not freed). Dangling pointers are always bugs,
and tracking them down is often quite difficult.

The .NET runtime provides additional services, to complete the promise
of memory safety, not naturally offered by a GC. It ensures that
programs do not index off the end of an array or accessing a phantom
field off the end of an object.

The following example will throw as a result of memory safety.

::

    int[] numbers = new int[42];
    int number = numbers[42]; // will throw (indexes are 0-based)

Type Safety
^^^^^^^^^^^

Objects are allocated in terms of types. The only operations allowed for
a given object, and the memory it consumes, are those of its type. A
``Dog`` type may have ``Jump`` and ``WagTail`` methods, but not likely a
``SumTotal`` method. A program can only call the declared methods of a
given type. All other calls will result in an exception.

.NET languages can be object*oriented, with hierarchies of base and
derived classes. The .NET runtime will only allow object casts and calls
that align with the object hierarchy.

::

    Dog dog = Dog.AdoptDog();
    Pet pet = (Pet)dog; // Dog derives from Pet
    pet.ActCute();
    Car car = (Car)dog; // will throw - no relationship between Car and Dog
    object temp = (object)dog; // legal - a Dog is an object
    car = (Car)temp; // will throw - the runtime isn't fooled
    car.Accelerate() // the dog won't like this, nor will the program get this far

Type safety also guarantees the fidelity of accessor keywords (e.g.
private, public, internal). This is particularly useful for non*public
data that an implementation uses to manage its behavior.

::

    Dog dog = Dog._nextDogToBeAdopted; // will throw - this is a private field

Delegates and Lambdas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Delegates are like C++ function pointers, but are type safe. They are a
kind of disconnected method within the CLR type system. Regular methods
are attached to a class and only directly callable through static or
instance calling conventions. Alternatively, delegates can be thought of
as a one method interface, without the interface.

Delegates define a type, which specify a particular method signature. A
method (static or instance) that satisfies this signature can be
assigned to a variable of that type, then called directly (with the
appropriate arguments) or passed as an argument itself to another method
and then called. The following example demonstrates delegate use.

::

        public delegate string Reverse(string s);

        static string ReverseString(string s)
        {
            return new string(s.Reverse().ToArray());
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Reverse rev = ReverseString;

            Console.WriteLine(rev("a string"));
        }

.NET includes a set of pre-defined delegate types - ``Func<>`` and ``Action<>`` -
that be used in many situations, without the requirement to define new
types. The example above can be re-written to no longer defined the
reverse delegate and instead define the rev variable as a Func. The
program will function the same.

::

    Func<string,string> rev = ReverseString;

Lambdas are a more convenient syntax for using delegates. They declare a
signature and a method body, but don't have an formal identity of their
own, unless they are assigned to a delegate. Unlike delegates, they can
be directly assigned as the left-hand side of event registration or as a
Linq select clause.

You can see the use of lambda as a linq select clause in the Linq
section above. The following example rewrites the program above using
the more compact lambda syntax. Note that an explictly defined delegate
could still be used, instead of Func<>.

::

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Func<string,string> rev = (s) => {return new string(s.Reverse().ToArray());};

        Console.WriteLine(rev("a string"));
    }

The following example demonstrated the use of a lambda as an event
handler.

::

    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        Loaded += (o, e) =>
        {
            this.Title = "Loaded";
        };
    }



Generic Types (Generics)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use generics all the time in C#, whether implicitly of explicitly. When you use LINQ in C#, did you ever notice that you are working with IEnumerable<T>? Or if you every saw an online sample of a "generic repository" for talking to databases using Entity Framework, did you see that most methods return IQueryable<T>? You may have wondered what the **T** is in these examples and why is it in there?

First introduced to the .NET Framework 2.0, generics involved changes to both the C# language and the Common Language Runtime (CLR). **Generics** are essentially a "code template" that allows developers to define `type-safe <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hbzz1a9a%28v=vs.110%29.aspx>`_ data structures without committing to an actual data type. For example, ``List<T>`` is a `Generic Collection <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Collections.Generic(v=vs.110).aspx>`_ that can be declared and used with any type: ``List<int>``, ``List<string>``, ``List<Person>``, etc.

So, what's the point? Why are generics useful? In order to understand this, we need to take a look at a specific class before and after adding generics. Let's look at the ``ArrayList``. In C# 1.0, the ``ArrayList`` elements were of type ``object``. This meant that any element that was added was silently converted into an ``object``; same thing happens on reading the elements from the list (this process is known as `boxing <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yz2be5wk.aspx>`_ and unboxing respectively). Boxing and unboxing have an impact of performance. More than that, however, there is no way to tell at compile time what is the actual type of the data in the list. This makes for some fragile code. Generics solve this problem by providing additional information the type of data each instance of list will contain. Put simply, you can only add integers to ``List<int>`` and only add Persons to ``List<Person>``, etc.

Generics are also available at runtime, or **reified**. This means the
runtime knows what type of data structure you are using and can store it
in memory more efficiently.

Here is a small program that illustrates the efficiency of knowing the
data structure type at runtime:

::

    using System;
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Diagnostics;

    namespace GenericsExample {
      class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
          //generic list
          List ListGeneric = new List { 5, 9, 1, 4 };
          //non-generic list
          ArrayList ListNonGeneric = new ArrayList { 5, 9, 1, 4 };
          // timer for generic list sort
          Stopwatch s = Stopwatch.StartNew();
          ListGeneric.Sort();
          s.Stop();
          Console.WriteLine($"Generic Sort: {ListGeneric}  \n Time taken: {s.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds}ms");

          //timer for non-generic list sort
          Stopwatch s2 = Stopwatch.StartNew();
          ListNonGeneric.Sort();
          s2.Stop();
          Console.WriteLine($"Non-Generic Sort: {ListNonGeneric}  \n Time taken: {s2.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds}ms");
          Console.ReadLine();
        }
      }
    }

This program yields the following output:

::

    Generic Sort: System.Collections.Generic.List\`1[System.Int32] Time taken: 0.0789ms
    Non-Generic Sort: System.Collections.ArrayList Time taken: 2.4324ms

The first thing you notice here is that sorting the generic list is
significantly faster than for the non-generic list. You might also
notice that the type for the generic list is distinct ([System.Int32])
whereas the type for the non-generic list is generalized. Because the
runtime knows the generic ``List<int>`` is of type int, it can store the
list elements in an underlying integer array in memory while the
non-generic ``ArrayList`` has to cast each list element as an object as
stored in an object array in memory. As shown through this example, the
extra castings take up time and slow down the list sort.

The last useful thing about the runtime knowing the type of your generic
is a better debugging experience. When you are debugging a generic in
C#, you know what type each element is in your data structure. Without
generics, you would have no idea what type each element was.

Async Programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Async is a first-class concept within .NET, with async support in the
runtime, the framework libraries and various .NET languages. Async is
based off of the ``Task`` concept, which encapsulates a set of
operations to be completed. Tasks are distinct from threads and may not
rely on threads or require CPU time much at all, particularly for
I/O-bound tasks.

TODO: Elaborate on Task concept.

C# includes special treatment for async, including the special keyword
``await`` for managing tasks. The following example demonstrates calling
a web endpoint as an async operation.

::

    string url = "http://someUrl";
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    string json = await client.GetStringAsync(url);

The call to ``client.GetStringAsync(url)`` does not block, but instead
immediately yields by returning a ``Task``. Computation resumes and the
call returns the requested string when the network activity has
completed.

Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.NET programs typically operate on some form of data. The data can be
database-resident or in the form of objects (sometimes called POCOs for
"Plain Old CLR Objects"). LINQ provides a language-integrated uniform
query model over data, independent of the source. Linq providers bridge
the gap between the uniform query model and the form of the data, such
as SQL Server tables, XML documents, standard collections like List and
more.

The follow examples demonstrate various uses of LINQ to query different
forms of data.

Native Interoperability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.NET provides low-level access to native APIs via the platform invoke or
P/Invoke facility. It enables a mapping of .NET types to native types,
which the .NET runtime marshalls before calling the native API.

TODO: Examples.

Higher-level native interop can be established with P/Invoke. The COM
and WinRT interop systems in the CLR are both built on top of P/Invoke.
The Java and Objective-C interop systems provided by Xamarin on top of
Mono are fundamentally the same.

Unsafe Code
~~~~~~~~~~~

The CLR enables the ability to acccess native memory and do pointer
arithmetic. These operations are needed for some algortithms and for
calling some native APIs. The use of these capabilities is discouraged,
since you no longer get the benefit of verifiability, nor will your code
be allowed to run in all environments. The best practice is to confine
unsafe code as much as possible and that the vast majority of code is
type-safe.

TODO: Examples.

Notes
-----

The term ".NET runtime" is used throughout the document to accomodate
for the multiple implementations of .NET, such as CLR, Mono, IL2CPP and
others. The more specific names are only used if needed.

This document is not intended to be historical in nature, but describe
the .NET platform as it is now. It isn't important whether a .NET
feature has always been available or was only recently introduced, only
that it is important enough to highlight and discuss.
